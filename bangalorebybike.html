                    <p>Research revealed that the concept of 'ride' represented something different to users. User’s motivations for riding and participating in the scheme differed, hinting at different requirements. After designating persona types and aligning this with the phasing strategy I could prioritise who to focus on supporting in the early stages. The phase 1 app focused on supporting the goals of Suhail and Ananya, the primary personas. 

                       <br><br> Persona hypothesis consisted of five different archetypes which was used to facilitate discovery about users needs, desires and varying contexts of use. Sufficient behavioural variables to segment user audience was identified. These variables could be categorised into activities such as frequency of use of the scheme, skills such as riding confidence and motivations such as reasons for cycling.</p>
