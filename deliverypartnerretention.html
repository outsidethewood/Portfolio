                    In the fiercely competitive landscape of the logistics industry, businesses are grappling with the challenge of retaining their delivery partners. With escalating competition and soaring attrition rates which goes as high as 50%, the need to address this issue has become critical.

                    This case study dives into the heart of the problem, aiming to provide effective solutions that will significantly boost long-term retention rates for organizations in the logistics sector. For this case study, I have specifically picked Swiggy to base my research and design on.

                        Based on research, I have identified the main factor affecting long term commitment to Swiggy as a sentiment of not being fairly rewarded. An approach is a tier-based rewards program. All participating partners automatically qualify for tier status and rewards. By earning points and maintaining a certain level of quality, they have the ability to unlock each tier status and rewards. We want to give drivers an alternative outlet to be rewarded.

                        A single catch all page for two ways to get this reward is much better than a status rewards details page that focuses on communicating how to unlock the reward. <br>
    
                            Ideally, there’d be no repetition between rewards unlocked with status and rewards purchased with points. However, this design was done for the likely chance that product needs will require this to happen.
